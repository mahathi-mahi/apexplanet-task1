Task 5: Finalization, Deployment, and Presentation
This phase involves preparing the app for release. One key aspect is setting up a CI/CD pipeline to automate builds and tests. This is typically done with tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins. The code below is a basic GitHub Actions workflow for an Android app.

android-ci.yml (Place this in .github/workflows/)

  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  pull_request:

    steps:

      with:
        java-version: '17'
